Private Hospitals SaaS Platform
Overview
The Private Hospitals SaaS Platform is a scalable, multi-tenant solution designed to manage various hospital operations efficiently. It supports multiple use cases, including patient management, billing, staff management, and analytics. The platform integrates user/team access management with Okta for authentication (AD/Okta integration), licensed-based usage, and is built to handle large-scale customers in a secure and flexible manner.
Key Features
•	User Authentication and Authorization: Secure user/team access using Okta for AD/SSO authentication.
•	Licensed-Based Usage: Manage hospitals' subscriptions and service tiers with different usage limits.
•	Multiple Use Cases:
o	Patient Management
o	Billing and Revenue Tracking
o	Staff Management
o	Hospital Analytics
•	Scalability: The application is built as a SaaS platform capable of handling thousands of users/customers.
•	Docker Support: Easily deployable using Docker for consistent production environments.

3. Environment Variables
You need to set up the following environment variables in a .env file in the root directory for Okta integration and any necessary configurations:
bash
```
Copy code
REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=https://your-org.okta.com/oauth2/default
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REACT_APP_OKTA_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/login/callback
```
For deployment environments, make sure to update these values with your Okta organization settings.

4. Authentication Setup
This application uses Okta for AD integration. Follow these steps to set up authentication:
1.	Sign up for an Okta Developer Account: https://developer.okta.com/signup
2.	Create an Okta Application:
o	Log in to your Okta dashboard.
o	Create a new application for Single Page App (SPA).
o	Set up redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:3000/login/callback).
3.	Update environment variables: Use your Okta client credentials in the .env file.
4.	Okta SDK: The app uses the Okta React SDK to manage user authentication.
